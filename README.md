# Project 4 - Makeup API

## Project Brief
 
Create an app that allows users to choose from the top 10 looks from any reliable online source and suggests products that would be used to achieve each specific look.  The user should be able to filter their search by different looks and and specific products by brand, price and ratings. Finally, the user must be able to rate these looks based on how accurate or useful they have found the information to be.
